#### Team-99: HexoVators

### We as a team could view the issue from two standpoints, marketing and a user engagement point of view.

### NGO : Uninhibited

### The issue

1) How to encourage users to visit the platform?
2) How to make rural men comfortable talking around SRH?
3) User retention and communication post subscription.
4) Help the target audience understand the natural functioning of the human body and the basic science behind it, in order to spread awareness among the community.
5) Providing a solution that is easily accessible, flexible, and affordable



### Our Solution 

1) We plan to associate with various UPI providers through which users can get to know about the organization via their scratch card facility, post which they would be aware of the free consultation call, the NGO has to offer .

2) To make the user experience engaging we have gamified the website through which users can learn about various topics and educate themselves without even realizing it.
